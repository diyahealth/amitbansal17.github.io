Learn More FAQ Can I get paid to care for a family member? We receive hundreds of calls every year from family and friends asking, “How can I get paid to care?” These caregivers aren’t asking for a handout, they are simply trying to find a way to make ends meet while dedicating their time to caregiving. Unfortunately, very few programs pay family members or friends on a regular basis to provide care. Medicare (government health insurance for people age 65 and older) does not pay for long-term care services, such as in-home care and adult day services, whether or not such services are provided by a direct care worker or a family member. Sometimes, however, caregiving families may obtain financial relief for specific purposes, such as for respite care or to purchase goods and services, and in some cases, pay for caregiving. In some states there are programs that pay family members to provide care to those receiving Medicaid (government health insurance for low-income people — this program may go by a different name in your state). And in a very few states there are programs available to those who do not qualify for Medicaid. NOTE: These programs vary widely, often with complicated criteria for eligibility. Steps to Consider: Use FCA’s Service by State tool to find resources in your state. Check out the section “Caregiver Compensation” for agencies that have programs that enable the care recipient to hire a family member to care for them. Your local Area Agency on Aging may be able to provide information on whether or not your state’s Medicaid program will pay a family member to provide care to a Medicaid recipient. Your Area Agency on Aging also manages the federally-supported program for family caregivers that can help ease the financial burden of caregiving to a person age 60 and older, or under 60 with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders. Program services include: information and assistance; counseling and support groups; education and training; respite care to give you a break; and supplemental services, including the purchase of consumable supplies, emergency response systems, and home modifications. To find your Area Agency on Aging, visit the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (N4A) and enter your city and state, or zip code, to find your local office. Your state may offer additional support programs for family caregivers. The American Elder Care Research Organization provides a listing of state Medicaid and non-Medicaid programs with consumer direction. (Consumer direction allows the Medicaid recipient to determine who will be paid, including a family member.) As well, you may wish to try their Paid Caregiver Program Locator to locate potential programs. Disease-specific organizations, such as CancerCare, may offer grants or other financial assistance to people with the disease and their family caregivers. For more information about these organizations visit national resources on FCA’s Family Care Navigator and click Disease-Specific Organizations. County Veterans Service Officers provide assistance in obtaining veterans benefits and answer questions regarding rules and regulations concerning veterans and survivors of veterans. National Association of County Veteran Service Officers (NACVSO) has an online locator that will direct you to your County Veteran Service Office or the Department of Veteran Affairs.

Can I get paid to care for a family member? How can I find someone to help care for my family member at home? Many older or disabled adults live at home but need daily assistance with a broad range of activities such as bathing, dressing, eating and taking their medications. They may also need assistance with household chores, such as cooking, cleaning and laundry. As a friend or relative, you may find it difficult to provide all of that help on your own. If you are providing care on a daily, weekly or even monthly basis, you may find that you need help or need a break. A variety of services are available to assist you and your family member. Generally, two types of care in the home are available: home health care services and in-home care services. If your family member requires regular assistance with health care needs, home health care organizations and skilled nursing agencies may be the best choice for you. They can provide a range of medical services, such as medication assistance, nursing services, physical therapy and medical social services to coordinate care among health care providers. Medicare, Medicaid and a number of private insurance policies pay for some home health care services, with certain restrictions. For example, Medicare will cover limited home health care for homebound beneficiaries who need intermittent skilled nursing or therapy services as prescribed by a physician. Many families, however, have to pay out of pocket for home health care services. If your family member needs help with daily activities and personal care, such as household chores, meal preparation or bathing, or is just in need of companionship, you likely are seeking in-home care services , rather than home health care. In-home care services offer assistance with everyday activities. The costs for these services and the eligibility requirements vary. Often, you will have to hire someone from an agency or someone you know and pay out of pocket. In some communities volunteer organizations may be able to help. While Medicare will not pay for these services, Medicaid (government health insurance for low-income people – this program may go by a different name in your state) covers limited in-home care or chore services for those who qualify. If your family member is age 60 or older, he\u002Fshe may also be eligible for other government programs administered through the local department on aging such as transportation services, meals programs (i.e., Meals on Wheels) and limited in-home personal care and chore services. For information on options for care in the home, read FCA’s fact sheet, Caregiving at Home: A Guide to Community Resources, and contact the following agencies: Eldercare Locator Connects older Americans (60+) and their caregivers with the local Area Agency on Aging, which provides information about local aging services, and community-based organizations. eldercare.acl.gov Medicare Home Health Compare An online tool that provides detailed information about Medicare-certified home health agencies across the country. www.medicare.gov\u002Fhomehealthcompare\u002Fsearch.html National Association for Home Care (NAHC) Provides an online resource to help consumers find home care providers in their state and local area. www.nahc.org Visiting Nurses Associations of America (VNAA) VNAs offer comprehensive home health care or personal care to individuals in their respective communities. This site lists VNAs near you: www.vnaa.org How can I find someone to help care for my family member at home? Help! I need a break! How can I find respite care? Caring for yourself is one of the most important things you can do as a caregiver. When your needs are taken care of, the person you care for will benefit too. Respite care provides family caregivers with temporary relief from day-to-day caregiving tasks, varying from a few hours to several weeks. Respite services can be provided through in-home care agencies, adult day services, facilities that allow short-term stays, individuals you hire directly or from friends and relatives willing to volunteer. Respite assistance is part of many caregiver support programs, including the Family Caregiver Support Program (FCSP) – available from your local department on aging. In addition, many private or nonprofit organizations offer fee-for-service respite assistance, including in-home assistance, a short-term stay in an assisted living facility or nursing home, or adult day services. Volunteer respite services are also available in many communities to provide companionship, protective supervision and other assistance. Don’t wait until you are overwhelmed and exhausted or your health fails. Respite services, as well as support groups with other caregivers and help from your family and friends, can be invaluable. Reaching out for help when you need it is an important part of the job. For more information about respite care and taking care of yourself, read FCA’s Fact Sheet Taking Care of YOU: Self-Care for Family Caregivers To find respite services available in your community, contact the following resources: ARCH National Respite Network The ARCH National Respite Network is a service to help caregivers and professionals locate respite services in their community. archrespite.org\u002Frespitelocator Eldercare Locator Connects older Americans (60+) and their caregivers with the local Area Agency on Aging’s Family Caregiver Support Program, which provides respite assistance, support groups and other services for caregivers. eldercare.acl.gov National Adult Day Services Association (NADSA) NADSA is membership organization with a directory of adult day services across the country. www.nadsa.org Help!

When your needs are taken care of, the person you care for will benefit too. Respite care provides family caregivers with temporary relief from day-to-day caregiving tasks, varying from a few hours to several weeks. Respite services can be provided through in-home care agencies, adult day services, facilities that allow short-term stays, individuals you hire directly or from friends and relatives willing to volunteer.\n\nRespite assistance is part of many caregiver support programs, including the Family Caregiver Support Program (FCSP) – available from your local department on aging. In addition, many private or nonprofit organizations offer fee-for-service respite assistance, including in-home assistance, a short-term stay in an assisted living facility or nursing home, or adult day services. Volunteer respite services are also available in many communities to provide companionship, protective supervision and other assistance.\n\nDon’t wait until you are overwhelmed and exhausted or your health fails. Respite services, as well as support groups with other caregivers and help from your family and friends, can be invaluable. Reaching out for help when you need it is an important part of the job.\n\nFor more information about respite care and taking care of yourself, read FCA’s Fact Sheet \u003Ca href=\"\u002Fresource\u002Ftaking-care-you-self-care-family-caregivers\u002F\"\u003ETaking Care of YOU: Self-Care for Family Caregivers\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\nTo find respite services available in your community, contact the following resources:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u003Cstrong\u003EARCH National Respite Network\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\n\nThe ARCH National Respite Network is a service to help caregivers and professionals locate respite services in their community.\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Farchrespite.org\u002Frespitelocator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Earchrespite.org\u002Frespitelocator\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEldercare Locator\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\n\nConnects older Americans (60+) and their caregivers with the local Area Agency on Aging’s Family Caregiver Support Program, which provides respite assistance, support groups and other services for caregivers.\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Feldercare.acl.gov\u002FPublic\u002FIndex.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Eeldercare.acl.gov\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENational Adult Day Services Association (NADSA)\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\n\nNADSA is membership organization with a directory of adult day services across the country.\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nadsa.org\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Ewww.nadsa.org\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n\n&nbsp;"}]},{name:e,attributes:{class:f},innerHTML:g}]}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("https:\u002F\u002Fwww.caregiver.org\u002F","link","Home - Family Caregiver Alliance","Learn More","CoreParagraph","block block--core-paragraph","","Family Caregiver Alliance","2022-11-30T21:17:10+00:00","https:\u002F\u002Fwww.caregiver.org\u002F#website","en-US","https:\u002F\u002Ffca.cacrc.org\u002Flogin","button","has-large-font-size","primary","Start Here","secondary","block block--core-shortcode","3","Can I get paid to care for a family member?","How can I find someone to help care for my family member at home?","Help!
