            p.post-container__text-block Patient and family-centered care is an approach that prioritizes the involvement of patients and their families in decision-making processes and treatment planning. Although traditionally associated with pediatric care, the authors of the article
                a(href='https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/patient-and-family-centered-care-its-not-just-pediatrics-anymore/2016-01' target='_blank') "Patient and Family-Centered Care: It's Not Just Pediatrics Anymore,"&nbsp;
                | published in the AMA Journal of Ethics, argue that healthcare institutions should expand patient and family-centered care across all medical specialties. By recognizing the significance of involving patients and their families in healthcare decisions, medical professionals can increase patient satisfaction, improve outcomes, and enhance care quality.
            p.post-container__text-block Involving patients and their families in decision-making processes has proven to increase patient satisfaction. Patients and families develop a stronger sense of ownership by actively participating in their own care. Subsequent feelings of empowerment and value contribute to a more positive healthcare experience.
            p.post-container__text-block Moreover, patient and family-centered care is associated with improved health outcomes. When patients are actively engaged in their treatment plans, they are more likely to adhere to prescribed therapies, follow through with medical advice, and make informed decisions. This increased engagement can lead to better clinical outcomes, reduced hospital readmissions, and improved overall health.
            p.post-container__text-block The authors argue that implementing patient and family-centered care requires the development of collaborative partnerships between healthcare professionals, patients, and families. It necessitates effective communication and education, respect for patients' values and preferences, and shared decision-making. Fostering a more collaborative environment can enhance the quality and appropriateness of care, ensuring that it aligns with patients' goals and values.
            p.post-container__text-block While patient and family-centered care has long been recognized as a standard in pediatric healthcare, the authors contend that it should be extended to all medical specialties. They highlight examples from various specialties, such as oncology and geriatrics, where patient and family involvement has resulted in better patient experiences and outcomes.
            p.post-container__text-block Patient and family-centered care should not be limited to pediatrics, but embraced across all medical specialties. Effectively involving the family will transform healthcare delivery to increase patient satisfaction, improve outcomes, and enhance care quality.
