            p.post-container__text-block Dr. Jain emphasized the importance of actively involving patients and families in care journies, stating that engaged patients tend to have better outcomes and a higher quality of life. By empowering patients and their families to actively participate in decision-making processes, home-based care providers can enhance care coordination and tailor services to meet individual needs effectively.
