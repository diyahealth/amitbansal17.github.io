                br
                span Systems of engagement is a transformative approach to healthcare. While traditional healthcare systems have focused primarily on systems of record (such as electronic health records) and systems of insight (data analytics and insights), systems of engagement shift the focus to actively engaging patients and enabling meaningful interactions between patients and healthcare providers.
