    p.post-container__text-block According to a recent study, engaging family members during the care transition process can help reduce hospital readmission rates. The study found that providing family members with clear communication and education decreased the likelihood of readmission.
    p.post-container__text-block The study involved over 800 patients and their family members across multiple healthcare facilities. Family members were included in the discharge process and provided educational materials on the patient's care plan and medication management. They also received follow-up communication to ensure a smooth transition back home.
    p.post-container__text-block The results showed that patients whose family members were engaged during the care transition process had a significantly lower readmission rate than those whose family members were not involved. This emphasizes the importance of family involvement in the care delivery process and the need for healthcare providers to recognize and support their roles in patient care.
    p.post-container__text-block This study highlights the potential benefits of engaging family members during care transitions, particularly in reducing hospital readmissions. Healthcare providers should prioritize caregiver involvement and provide them with the necessary resources and support to ensure a successful transition back home for the patient.
