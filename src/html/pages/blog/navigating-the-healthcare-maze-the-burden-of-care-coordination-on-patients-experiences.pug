        | explores strategies health systems can implement to better support patients and families as they navigate their care.
    p.post-container__text-block While care coordination is essential, the burden it places on patients can undermine their overall experience within the healthcare system. Patients often find themselves caught in a web of complex tasks including scheduling appointments, managing referrals, coordinating medical records, and communicating with multiple healthcare providers. These added responsibilities not only strain patients emotionally but also demand significant time and effort, leading to increased stress and frustration.
    p.post-container__text-block Moreover, this burden negatively impacts patient outcomes. Overwhelmed patients may experience lapses in care, delays in treatment, or even medical errors due to miscommunication or incomplete information exchange between healthcare providers. Such breakdowns in care coordination not only compromise patient safety, but also hinder effective care delivery.
    p.post-container__text-block To avoid decreases in experience scores and patient safety ratings, healthcare organizations should address this issue proactively. Examples of potential strategies include:
        ol
            li Utilize digital health technology to streamline and standardize communication
            li Empower patients with comprehensive, accessible educational resources
            li Foster a culture of collaboration and communication among various care teams

    p.post-container__text-block These strategies promote a patient-family-centered care model, so all essential stakeholders are actively engaged in coordinating care, reducing the burden on patients. By involving patients and families in the care planning process and providing key educational resources, healthcare organizations can ease patientsâ€™ stress for improved experiences and better outcomes.
