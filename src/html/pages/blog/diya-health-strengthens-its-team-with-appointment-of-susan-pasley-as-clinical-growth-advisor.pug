    p.post-container__text-block “Information and data are abundant in healthcare and used to drive everything from clinical decisions to quality and operational measures. Despite this plethora of available information, the industry has yet to leverage it effectively to connect the triad of patient, family and caregiver in meaningful ways to promote engagement, streamline communication and drive outcomes. Diya Health has developed an amazing platform that closes this gap and efficiently and effectively connects the triad,” said Pasley. “I am thrilled to be a part of an organization that is creating improved patient and family experiences and caregiver efficiencies while driving health outcomes.”
