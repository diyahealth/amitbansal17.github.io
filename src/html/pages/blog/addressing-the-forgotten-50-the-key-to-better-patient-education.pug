        a(href="https://patientengagementhit.com/news/50-of-patients-forget-treatment-plans-need-better-patient-education") according to researchers at the University of Michigan School of Medicine
        |, 50% of patients forget their treatment plans after discharge. This forgetfulness and subsequent lack of adherence lead to reduced treatment effectiveness, increased healthcare costs, and poorer outcomes. To boost post-discharge treatment plan adherence, patients require improved education and engagement.
    p.post-container__text-block Several factors contribute to patients' inability to remember treatment plans effectively. The complex information provided during inpatient stays leaves patients feeling overloaded and confused. Also, low health literacy and language barriers make it even more difficult for patients to understand and remember this information. Time constraints during clinical rounds further exacerbate the problem, as patients need more time to comprehend information and thoroughly think of important questions. Moreover, patients' anxiety and stress associated with their health condition further hinder their ability to absorb and retain treatment details.
