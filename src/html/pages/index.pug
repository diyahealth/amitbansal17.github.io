                It can receive data from any standard healthcare system, is compliant with personal-security standards, and can be used in emergencies as a personal
                “medical alert bracelet.”  It allows for remote referrals, monitoring of symptoms, alerts about medications
                (e.g., dosage duplications or contraindications), among other capabilities. Most importantly, the information is controlled by,
                    owned by, and travels with the patient, regardless of changes in doctor, medical plan, residence, or caregiver.
