                    Using advanced algorithms, data science, and artificial-intelligence capability, we have developed a product that was inconceivable only a few years ago.  It is a software-as-a-service digital platform for use as a personal health diary.  It receives, stores, and updates all of a patient's medical information, making it available to anyone the patient wishes — doctors, family members, and caregivers.  It facilitates telehealth as well as communication among a patient's health providers.  It is easy to use in any language.  It improves health outcomes.

                    Diya is a word of Arabic origin that means "radiance."  It has been adopted by South-Asian culture as a name for a primitive lamp — a small handmade clay bowl that, with a bit of oil and a wick, creates light.  It symbolizes optimism and prosperity.  It lights the dark and gives a sense of calm.
