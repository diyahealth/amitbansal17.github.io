                        p Diya Health, a Silicon Valley-based digital health startup, was founded in 2018 as a partnership of doctors and engineers who were looking to shine a light on the darkness of information in healthcare.
                        p Diya, a word of Arabic origin, means “radiance.” It has been adopted by South-Asian culture as a name for a primitive lamp, and symbolizes optimism and prosperity. It lights the dark and gives a sense of calm. 
                        p By engaging clinicians, patients, and families in healthcare, Diya Health lives up to its name — it lights the dark.
